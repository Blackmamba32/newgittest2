        <h2 font="Wendy One">Batman</h2>
       <p class="a"> Batman has been Gotham's protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the Justice League. is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger and published by DC Comics. The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne. Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in Gotham City, assisted by various supporting characters including his sidekick Robin and his butler Alfred Pennyworth, and fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.</p>

       <p class="a">
       Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, Batman. As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in the 1986 miniseries Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, by writer-artist Frank Miller. That and the success of director Tim Burton's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.</p>

      Batman: The Movie (1966):<br>

The first full length movie, starring Adam West as Batman.  A movie that the current crop of Batfans might not like, but nevertheless an important part of the character's film history.</div>
    <div class="col25 " id="sidebyside"><img src="images/batman2.jpeg"><br>
      Batman (1989):<br>
Directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton, Batman is considered to be a cult classic among the dark knight fans.
The movie set up the dark and gritty Batman which was in stark contrast with Adam West's portrayal.  The movie is also credited to have paved the path for future superhero movies.

    <div class="col25" id="sidebyside"><img src="images/batman3.jpg"><br>
Batman Returns (1992):<br>

Tim Burton and Michael Keaton came together again to make the sequel to much acclaimed Batman.  Although the movie was able to hold its own weight, the reviews were a little mixed considering the comparisons with previous movie in the series.

    <div class="col25 " id="sidebyside"><img src="images/batman4.gif"><br>
      Batman Forever (1995):<br>

Due to the unexpectedly low box office collections of Batman Returns, Warner Bros. replaced Burton with Joel Schumacher and Keaton with Val Kilmer.  A little over the top, especially for the current generation, Batman Forever is a movie you can watch for Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey.

    Batman & Robin (1997):<br>

Joel Schumacher returned as the director, whereas Val Kilmer was replaced by George Clooney.  Hailed as one of the worst superhero movies ever, you might want to stay clear of this one. 
Weird dialogues accompanied with a toy-ish feel, the movie fails to impress big time.  And no one can really forget the Bat Nipple fiasco.   
  
  </div>
  <div class="col25" ><img src="images/batman6.gif"><br>
    Batman Begins (2005):<br>

Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale came together to revive a character that had been massacred by Schumacher and Clooney.  And boy was it worth it.
The first installment of the best superhero trilogy ever, Batman Begins proved to be exactly what the doctor ordered.  A dark, gritty, humane interpretation of the character that was as close to the comic book version as one could get.  Also one of the best origins movie ever.

  <div class="col25" ><img src="images/batman7.gif"><br>
   The Dark Knight (2008):<br>

The best superhero movie ever made.  Heath Ledger as Joker is one of the most iconic roles in the entire history of films.  The movie is full of memorable dialogues, beautiful scenes, wonderful acting, and awe inspiring direction.
Personally, this is the movie that comes closest to absolute cinematic perfection for me.

  The Dark Knight Rises (2012): <br>

A worthy ending to a great story.  It really speaks about the greatness of a trilogy when a movie of the level of The Dark Knight Rises is actually the third best movie of the series.  
Tom Hardy as Bane was phenomenal.  Christian Bale is yet to disappoint me.  And Nolan is just a wonderfully beautiful creation that we should all be thankful for.
